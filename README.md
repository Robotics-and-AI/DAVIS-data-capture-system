## Introduction

Event-based sensors encode visual information asynchronously with low latency and high temporal resolution.  
Event-based datasets are scarce, so user-friendly methods for creating said datasets are required.

This repository contributes with code to record a dataset with a DAVIS240C event camera.  
The code was used to record and process the following open-source event-based datasets:
- <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10562563">Event-based Dataset of Assembly Tasks (EDAT24)</a> 
- <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15005301">Re-defined Event-based Dataset of Assembly Tasks (REDAT24)</a>.

All data are captured in raw form (.aedat) and can be processed into numpy arrays (.npy) for ease of use.

## Requirements

- A <a href="https://docs.inivation.com/_static/hardware_guides/davis240.pdf">DAVIS240C event camera</a> - to obtain the data
- The <a href="http://jaerproject.org">jAER open-source software</a> - to display and record the data
- An <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino board</a> - to trigger the commands to start and end the recordings

A detailed explanation on how to utilize the code is provided below
